Airport collaborative decision-making
Improving the efficiency and resilience of airport operations by optimising the use of resources and improving the predictability of air traffic.
THIS IS PART OF
Optimised operational performance | Network Manager
Airport CDM (A-CDM) aims to improve the efficiency and resilience of airport operations by optimising the use of resources and improving the predictability of air traffic. It achieves this by encouraging the airport partners (airport operators, aircraft operators, ground handlers and ATC) and the Network Manager to work more transparently and collaboratively, exchanging relevant accurate and timely information. It focuses especially on aircraft turn-round and pre-departure processes.
It also allows the exchange of more accurate departure information, particularly target take-off times, with the European ATFCM network, leading to improved en-route and sectoral planning. For smaller airports, we also provide a more accessible alternative caller Advanced ATC tower concept.
Implementation
Airport CDM is now globally recognised. A-CDM is fully implemented in 34 airports across Europe, including Alicante, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Bergamo, Berlin Brandenburg, Brussels, Copenhagen, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva, Hamburg, Helsinki, Lisbon, London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Lyon, Madrid, Málaga, Milan Linate, Milan Malpensa, Munich, Naples, Nice, Oslo, Palma de Mallorca, Paris CDG, Paris Orly, Prague, Riga, Rome Fiumicino, Stuttgart, Venice, Vienna, and Zurich. This map  provides and overview of the current status of A-CDM implementation at European airports. Where available, it also gives some information on A-CDM procedures in place. This information has been provided by the airports and verified by the Network Manager.

Advanced ATC TWR
For smaller airports where there is no justification for a full A-CDM implementation the possibility to integrate with the ATFCM Network is offered by the Advanced ATC Tower concept, sharing a very small sub-set of A-CDM information with the network. This option is also available to those airports that want to take a step towards full A-CDM.

Based on the A-CDM concept, the EUROCONTROL Network Manager also involves in the implementation of new and add-on concepts to support the even deeper integration of airports with the network. Here we take the lead in putting research into practice and further enhance and improve the collaboration between the partners in the network.
EOBT for A-CDM
At collaborative decision-making (A-CDM) airports, the target off-block time (TOBT) values reflect any delays that can be attributed to the aircraft operator (AO) or to the ground handling operations. To help reduce the workload for our partners, we provide a service to automatically solve the EOBT – TOBT discrepancies, depending on the AO preferences and prevent last minute flight disturbances caused by misalignment of EOBT with TOBT.
